PioneerDesktop
==============

A small windows application (C#) to control my Pioneer VSX-1123 . It can probaby be used with other Pioneer receivers too.

Based on what I saw here: http://raymondjulin.com/2012/07/15/remote-control-your-pioneer-vsx-receiver-over-telnet/

It includes Discovery (SSDP), pretty basic though...!
